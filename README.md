## What is Pascal's triangle
One of the most interesting Number Patterns in Mathematics is the Pascal's Triangle (named after Blaise Pascal, a French Mathematician and a Philosopher). To build the triangle, we need to start with "1" at the top, then continue placing numbers below it in a particular pattern such that each number is the numbers directly above it added together.
### Usage
